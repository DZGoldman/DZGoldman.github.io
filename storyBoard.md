The Sudoku Player:

Starting Elements:
-An empty 9x9 board
-A readout, instructing the player to input their starting grid, and then click "start."
-Four pre-set starting grids ("easy", "medium," "hard," and "impossible") that a player can click to use instead of inputing their own.
-A "start" button, which a player clicks once the starting grid is put in.
-A "clear" button, which clears the board.

Once "start," is clicked, the readout will display "wait..." while the program solves it and then "start solving!" when it's ready. At this point, the program has the solution stored behind the scenes. (If the Sudoku is impossible to solve, the readout will say so) At this point, two new buttons will appear:

Check: While solving, a player can click this at any time. It will turn the players correct guesses green and incorrect guesses red.

Give Up?: This will reveal the solved grid.


Optional add ons:
-A "hint?" button, which corrects one the player's mistakes or, if there are no mistakes yet, reveals a cell at random.

-A 6x6 option
